### OpenPackage CLI Specs

This directory contains the **canonical** implementation-guiding specifications for the OpenPackage CLI, with the primary architecture being the path-based model. The codebase reflects this (path-based source of truth, mutable vs. immutable sources, unified workspace index, directory-based local registry). Specifications are organized by topic, with top-level overview files providing cohesion.

#### Design Principles

- **Focused**: Each command serves one clear purpose, avoiding overload.
- **Surgical**: Strict separation of mutable development sources from immutable distribution snapshots, with enforcement via errors.
- **Simple**: Paths are the universal source of truth; a single unified index manages all tracking.
- **Reliable**: Built-in guards prevent common errors, like mutating published registry content.

For full philosophy, data flows, and layered model, see [Architecture](architecture.md).

#### Key Concepts

- **Path-Based Source of Truth**: All packages resolve to a filesystem path. Dependencies use explicit `path:` or infer from `version:` (registry) or `git:` (cloned path). Git sources support subdirectory navigation for monorepos and Claude Code plugins.
- **Mutable vs. Immutable Sources**: 
  - Mutable (e.g., local/global packages dirs): Support editing via `save`/`add`.
  - Immutable (e.g., registry dirs): Read-only; `save`/`add` fail.
- **Unified Workspace Index**: `.openpackage/openpackage.index.yml` tracks packages, sources, versions, and file mappings across the workspace—no fragmented per-package files.
- **Directory-Based Local Registry**: `~/.openpackage/registry/<name>/<version>/` for simple, direct access without tarballs.

#### Command Flow Diagram

```
Workspace ←──apply/install── Source/Registry (mutable or immutable)
Workspace ──save/add──────→ Source (mutable only; fails on registry)
Source ────pack───────────→ Registry (immutable snapshot)
Registry ──push/pull─────→ Remote Registry (future)
```

Detailed semantics in [Commands Overview](commands-overview.md) and command subdirs (e.g., [Save](save/), [Pack](pack/)).

#### Breaking Changes from Prior Versions

The architecture introduces breaking changes with no automated migration—re-initialize workspaces:
- Removed complex WIP versioning (now prereleases in registry), workspace hash tracking, per-package metadata directories, and tarball-based registry.
- Unified `openpackage.index.yml` replaces scattered index files.
- All registry storage is directory-based for inspectability and path compatibility.
- Path-based dependencies and mutability guards replace prior behaviors; re-run `opkg install` for workspaces. Use `opkg new` to create packages.
- No backward compatibility for removed features like staging mutations or link-only WIP layouts.

Consult git history (e.g., commit 9d23bf2) for prior version details. See [Architecture](architecture.md) for removed/retained metadata.
