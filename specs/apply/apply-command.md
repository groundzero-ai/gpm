### Apply – Command Contract

#### 1. Overview

`opkg apply` performs a platform apply/sync pass for a package in the **effective cwd** (shell cwd or `--cwd <dir>`).

It is the standalone equivalent of `opkg save --apply`, except it does not write a new registry snapshot first.

---

#### 2. Usage

- Apply current/root package:
  - `opkg apply`
- Apply a specific package by name:
  - `opkg apply <package-name>`

> Package resolution follows the same context detection rules as other pipelines: if `<package-name>` matches the root package, apply targets the root package; otherwise it targets a nested package when found.

---

#### 3. Flags

- `--force`
  - Overwrites on conflicts (equivalent to `conflictStrategy=overwrite`).
- `--dry-run`
  - Plans apply/sync operations without writing files or updating the package index.

Global:

- `--cwd <dir>`
  - Changes the effective cwd for package detection and apply targets. See `../cli-options.md`.

---

#### 4. Output

Apply prints:

- A summary header (`Applied <name>@<version> ...`).
- The list of package files considered.
- A platform sync summary (created/updated/removed file paths) when operations occur.
