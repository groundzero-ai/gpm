### Apply Specs

This directory defines the behavior of **apply** (a.k.a. platform apply/sync): projecting a package’s canonical content into **platform-specific workspace layouts**, and updating `package.index.yml` to reflect what is actually installed.

Apply can be triggered in two ways:

- `opkg apply` – explicit apply/sync.
- `opkg save --apply` – save to the local registry and then apply/sync.

> `opkg save` / `opkg pack` without `--apply` write registry snapshots but do not mutate platform workspaces.
